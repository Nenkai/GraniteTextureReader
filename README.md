# GraniteTextureReader

Texture Reader/Extractor for [Granite SDK](https://unity.com/products/granite-sdk) files (.gts/.gtp). This tool was primarly made with Granblue Fantasy: Relink in mind, but should also support extracting from Unity games using [Streaming Virtual Texturing](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/svt-streaming-virtual-texturing.html).

File format documentation/010 Editor Template is available [here](https://github.com/Nenkai/010GameTemplates/blob/main/Graphine/Granite%20SDK/TileSet_GTS.bt).

> [!WARNING]
> There are known issues related to extracting Granite SDK textures out of later Unity games. This project is currently in stand-by and will not currently receive updates unless contributions are made (which are welcome).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Only version 6 `.gts` files are currently supported. (Version can be viewed at 0x04 in the .gts files)
